row - axis=0
column - axis=1


we can access components of a dataframe via index, column and value

columns type index
rows type array

the inplace parameter mutates the df

rows can be added using the dataframe constructor and concating the rows into the existing dataframe


when performing any tranformation that requires reviewing the index it is necessary to reset it
for example, when concating 2 dataframes, their indexes will be unchangable and may repeat in this new combined dataframe


selecting a single column using square brackets returns a series
if more than 1 column, the returned object is a dataframe

just like lists, we can select using slicing as well
df[x:y] -- x is where the row starts; y is where the row ends counting from one


using loc
df.loc[x:y] -- x is where we start, y is where the row ends based on index counting from zero
or
df.loc[[1,2,3]] --via indexes
or
df.loc[first:last:step]

loc can be used to select the index value

iloc works just like loc, but with integers instead of labels


selection based on content:
example:

df.loc[df["col"]=="somevalue"]
